## Credits

This application is based on <a href="https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webtypist">WebTypist (Github)</a>, version 1, which has been abandoned.

Credits also to the KDE project <a href="https://kde.org/applications/education/org.kde.ktouch">ktouch</a> for providing lessons for a lot of languages.

Credits to <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> to provide a lot of material that can be used as excercises.

Last and not least to mention that the project would not be possible without the precious remarks from users.

A demo is available here: https://www.blueseal.eu/rasyti/.
