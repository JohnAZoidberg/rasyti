# Rašyti
Rašyti is a multilingual and multi-keyboard online touch typing trainer, currently covering English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Lithuanian, Croatian, Slovenian, Danish, Catalan, Hungarian, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Finnish.

"Rašyti" is Lithuanian and means "to write". Lithuanian was the first language that I added since I am working on it.

This application is based on WebTypist version 1, see credits below. Since then, a lot of further languages and lessons have been added.

The word "rašyti" is Lithuanian and means "to write". The reason why I chose the name is simply that Lithuanian was the first language that I added.

## Credits

This application is based on <a href="https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webtypist">WebTypist (Github)</a>, version 1, which has been abandoned.

Credits also to the KDE project <a href="https://kde.org/applications/education/org.kde.ktouch">ktouch</a> for providing lessons for a lot of languages.

Credits to <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> to provide a lot of material that can be used as excercises.

Last and not least to mention that the project would not be possible without the precious remarks from users.

A demo is available here: https://www.blueseal.eu/rasyti/.
