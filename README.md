# Rašyti
Rašyti is a multilingual and multi-keyboard online touch typing trainer, currently covering English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Lithuanian, Croatian, Slovenian, Danish, Catalan, Hungarian, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Finnish.

"Rašyti" is Lithuanian and means "to write". Lithuanian was the first language that I added since I am working on it.
